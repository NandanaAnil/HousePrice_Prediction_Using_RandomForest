Project Title: House Price Prediction Using Random Forest Regression

Overview:
Built an end‑to‑end machine learning pipeline to predict residential home sale prices using the Random Forest algorithm. This project highlights data exploration, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and inference on new input.

Key Steps:

Data Ingestion & Exploration

Loaded a comprehensive housing dataset containing numerical features such as lot area, year built, overall quality, neighborhood indicators, etc.

Visualized distributions and outliers via boxplots (using Matplotlib & Seaborn) to inform cleaning decisions.

Preprocessing

Handled missing values and encoded categorical variables (if any) to prepare a clean feature matrix.

Separated the target variable (SalePrice) from input features.

Train/Test Split

Partitioned the data into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets using train_test_split for an unbiased evaluation.

Modeling

Trained a RandomForestRegressor (default hyperparameters) to capture non‑linear relationships and reduce overfitting through ensemble averaging.

Evaluation

Assessed performance with the R² score on both training and test sets, demonstrating the model’s ability to generalize.

Example output:

nginx

Accuracy on training data: 0.98  
Accuracy on testing data: 0.85  

Prediction

Deployed the trained model to predict sale prices on new, unseen house specifications.

Technologies & Libraries:

Python: Core scripting

Pandas & NumPy: Data manipulation

Matplotlib & Seaborn: Exploratory data analysis

Scikit‑learn: Model building (RandomForestRegressor), train/test splitting, and evaluation metrics

Jupyter Notebook: Interactive development environment
